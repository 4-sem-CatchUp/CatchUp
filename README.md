# 🪩 CatchUp — 4th Semester Exam Project (Team 7, Datamatiker 2025)

**CatchUp** is a European-focused **social media platform** developed as our 4th-semester project.  
The goal is to build a *transparent, decentralized and GDPR-friendly* alternative to existing social media platforms — combining a clean architecture backend, a modern React/TypeScript frontend, and a gamified user experience.


## 🧱 System Overview

The system consists of multiple parts working together:

- **Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)** — the main web client for posts, profiles, comments, and messaging  
- **Backend (C# / .NET 8)** — built around **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** for modularity and scalability  
- **Game / Gamification Module (Unity)** — provides a connected hub experience and achievement system  

The architecture is intentionally modular to mirror a real-world microservice-inspired system while keeping development manageable for a student team.


## ⚙️ Technologies Used

### Frontend  
- React 18 + TypeScript  
- Vite  
- Tailwind CSS 
- ESLint + Prettier + Husky (pre-commit linting/testing)  
- Coderabbit (AI-assisted code review and automated unit tests)  

### Backend  
- .NET 8 / C#  
- Entity Framework Core  
- Clean / Hexagonal Architecture  
- PostgreSQL (planned)  
- xUnit for testing  

### Gamification / Unity  
- Unity 6 (C#)  
- Custom 3D assets and environment design  
- Player/NPC interaction system and achievement triggers  

## 🧩 Core Architecture (Backend)

The backend is organized into multiple *cores* under the main solution:

| Core | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **SocialCore** | Handles posts, comments, chat, and profiles |
| **AchievementCore** | Gamification logic, XP and badge progression |
| **UserAuthCore** | Authentication, authorization, and user management |
| **ActivityPubCore** | Federated communication between instances |
| **NotificationCore** | System-wide notifications through an event broker |

Each core defines its own **domain layer**, **ports**, and **adapters**, making them individually testable and extensible.

## 🚀 Running the Frontend Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/4-sem-CatchUp/CatchUp.git
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

The app will start on http://localhost:5173/
```

## 🧪 Testing & Automation

Prettier + ESLint ensure code consistency

Husky triggers lint/test on every commit

Coderabbit performs automatic code reviews and test validations on PR merge

Vitest / Jest used for unit tests

Example:

```bash
npm run test
```

## 🧭 Vision

“A social media platform built around community, privacy, and transparency — not ads.”

CatchUp is meant as a proof-of-concept for an ethical, European alternative to commercial social networks.
It experiments with decentralization, gamified engagement, and responsible data ownership while remaining fully open-source.
